-- Description: This view provides IMS Global OneRoster v1.1 Grading Periods output based on a database.
-- Documentation: A Grading Period (GP) is the period of time for the entire length of a course or class.  
Most school configurations involve one grading period that lasts an entire year; however, if courses last for shorter 
periods of time (e.g., one month) and do not need to be averaged for final grades, schools may opt to use multiple periods per year.
